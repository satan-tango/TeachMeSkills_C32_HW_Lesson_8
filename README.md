# Task Completed:

## Task 1
Implement all "TODO" that are specified in the code

## Task 2
Create an Apple class and add a color field with the private access modifier to it and
initialize it. In the main method of another class, create an Apple object and without
using setters change the value of the color field

## Task 3
Create a program to simulate the work of a clinic. Let there be three doctors in the clinic: a surgeon, a therapist, and a dentist. Each doctor has a "treat" method, but each doctor treats in his or her own way. Also provide a "Patient" class with a "Treatment Plan" field and a "Doctor" field. Create an object of the "Patient" class and add a treatment plan to the patient. Create a method for the therapist that will assign a doctor to the patient according to the treatment plan:
If the treatment plan has code 1, assign a surgeon and perform the treat method.
If the treatment plan has code 2, assign a dentist and perform the treat method.
If the treatment plan has any other code, assign a therapist and perform the treat method.
